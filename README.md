# MD TO HTML

Bash script that turns Markdown docs into HTML files with pandoc. Really simple project and it has much to improve.

## Usage

`mdtohtml.sh foldername`

`foldername` should be the directory where the md files are.

## Limitations

* This directory **must** exist in the same directory as the directories with the markdown files you wish to convert
* No sanity checking of any kind. Will blindly turn convert any md to html without a second thought :D
